# docs-partners - THIS REPO IS NO LONGER ACTIVE

Or, it shouldn't be active, anyway. So please don't work in it or submit PRs against it.

The new location for Pivotal Partner documentation and internal Service team documentation for building tiles and BOSH releases is the **[docs-book-tiledev](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/docs-book-tiledev)** repo, for the [PCF Tile Developers Guide](http://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev).

Thank you for your consideration.
